# ROAD2H-hooks
Documentation for a pair of CDS hooks to trigger notifications for remote decision support on the management of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (and possibly with Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) and/or Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) comorbidities). The CDS services provided -as part of the COPD CDS system- are the assessment of the COPD severity in the patient and a personalised COPD treatment planning that takes into account potential conflicts with CVD and CKD comorbidities.

The CDS hooks habe been developed as part of the ROAD2H project.

## Hooks folder
The folder contains the pair of hook specifications, with examples, to trigger CDS services for COPD management. The hook with ID 'copd-assess' provides patient information on previous and current COPD symptoms, and is associated with the COPD severity assessment CDS service. The hook with ID 'copd-careplan-select' provides patient information on active COPD treatments, the current pulmonologist-verified COPD severity assessment as well as on the status of current vaccinations and active comorbidities. This hook is associated with the COPD treatment planning CDS service.

## Json_files
Contains CDS card responses to the examples displayed in the CDS hook definitions.

## ForecastEffect FHIR Resource
This folder contains the schema for the new FHIR type, ForecastEffect, that describes the expected effects of a care action on the overall health of a patient if a particular clinical treatment or service is administered. The FHIR forecastEffect permits mapping clinical suggestions in the form of Transition-based Medical Recommendations (TMRs) to FHIR types. FHIR does not include resources to describe potential outcomes.

## Database forms
This folder holds the forms feds to the Data Management Interoperability Microservice in order to extract and manipulate data from a COPD patient to convert them into new data for finding current COPD severity and drugs priority, copd-assess hook, or for providing ontology-based decision support using the TMR web service, copd-careplan-select hook.
